# BarChart - Component

## What is a bar chart needed for?

A bar chart is very suitable if you want to compare many different data series with each other. 
Mostly in a certain period of time.

## Basic example

Below you can see an accessible diagram, with all its functions. Feel free to navigate with the 
tab key to navigate over the diagram. The screen reader will recognize 
the necessary text areas and read them to you.


export const Template = (args) => ({
  Component: BarChart,
  props: args,
});

<Canvas>
  <Story 
    name="Basic example"
    args={{
      chartInfo: {
        title: "Revenue of three big companies",
        desc: "The bar chart shows the revenue for Apple, Google and Microsoft divided in the seasons.",
        source: "https://www.w3.org"
      },
      labels: {x: "Seasons", y: "Euro in million", secondY: ''},
      series: testTwoBarSeries,
      hatchPatterns: true,
    }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Step by Step

So you understand what's happening. Let's create the previous diagram step by step. 
The following command, creates an empty diagram:
```
<BarChart />
```
<Canvas>
  <Story name="Empty Chart">
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Adding Information

In order to understand what the chart should represent, we will add some information to the chart. 
For this we use the data type **ChartInfo**. With **ChartInfo** you can give the chart a title, 
a description and a source. The special thing about the title is that the chart automatically generates the correct header tag.
Should there be a **h1**-tag on the web page, 
the title will automatically adapt and create a **h2**-tag.

```ts
import type {ChartInfo} from '../types/attributes/ChartInfo.types';

export let chartInfo: ChartInfo = {
  title: "Revenue of three big companies",
  desc: "The bar chart shows the revenue for Apple, Google and Microsoft divided in the seasons.",
  source: "https://www.w3.org"
} as ChartInfo
```

<Canvas>
  <Story 
    name="Adding Information"
    args={{
        chartInfo: {
        title: "Revenue of three big companies",
        desc: "The bar chart shows the revenue for Apple, Google and Microsoft divided in the seasons.",
        source: "https://www.w3.org"
      },
    }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Modification of Labels

To give the reader more information and to explain the bars in more detail, you can use **Labels**.
Labels is a data type that allows you to add axis labels to the chart. 
**Labels** takes three parameters:
- x: Defines the label of the x-axis
- y: Defines the label of the Y-axis 
- secondY: Defines the label of the second Y-axis

```ts
import {type Labels} from '../types/attributes/Labels.type';

export let labels: Labels = {x: "Seasons", y: "Euro in million", secondY: ''} as Labels;
```
<Canvas>
  <Story 
    name="Modifying labels"
    args={{
        chartInfo: {
        title: "Revenue of three big companies",
        desc: "The bar chart shows the revenue for Apple, Google and Microsoft divided in the seasons.",
        source: "https://www.w3.org"
      },
      labels: {x: "Seasons", y: "Euro in million", secondY: ''},
    }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Adding series

To visualize numbers, we still need to give the Series to the diagram. For each diagram there is a suitable
data type. For a bar chart we use **BarSeries**. Furthermore we need 
the data types **Bar** and **BarValue**.

```ts
import type { BarSeries, BarValue, Bar } from '../types/series/BarSeries.type';

const appleBarValues: BarValue[] = [
  {
    value: 10,
    ariaLabel: 'The revenue in spring for Apple is: ',
  },
];

const appleRevenue: Bar = {
  name: 'Apple',
  barValues: appleBarValues,
};

export const testBarSeries: BarSeries = {
  series: [appleRevenue],
  category: ['Spring', 'Summer', 'Autumn', 'Winter'],
};
```
With **BarValue** we create an array with the individual values and the appropriate Aria label text. 
**Bar** groups the individual values and gives them a name. **BarSeries** groups them together and
category determines the content of the X-axis.

<Canvas>
  <Story 
    name="Adding series"
    args={{
        chartInfo: {
        title: "Revenue of three big companies",
        desc: "The bar chart shows the revenue for Apple, Google and Microsoft divided in the seasons.",
        source: "https://www.w3.org"
      },
      labels: {x: "Seasons", y: "Euro in million", secondY: ''},
      series: testTwoBarSeries,
    }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Theming

You can add colors to the diagram. But you don't have to. The library provides automatically defined colors.
You can find them in "src/theme/defaultTheme.ts". Here is an example:

```ts

import { HATCH_PATTERNS } from '../types/theme/Hatch.type.ts';
import { CONTRAST_COLORS } from '../types/theme/Theme.type.ts';
import type { BarTheme } from '../types/theme/Theme.type';

export const defaultBarTheme: BarTheme = {
  name: 'barDefaultTheme',
  colors: CONTRAST_COLORS,
  focusColor: '#66ff99',
  wrapperStyles: {
    backgroundColor: '#F7F7F7',
  },
  grid: {
    gridColor: '',
    gridSize: '',
  },
  hatches: [HATCH_PATTERNS.CIRCLES, HATCH_PATTERNS.DIAGONAL, HATCH_PATTERNS.H_LINE],
};
```
At this point, there is one more small feature. The library creates a CSS variable from each attribute.
Except **colors**. For example, if you want to use the color of the wrapper in the style, 
you can write the following:

```css
.an_element{
  background-color: var(--wrapperStyles-backgroundColor);
}
```

### Dimension

With **Dimension** you can give the diagram a fixed width and size:
```ts
import type {Dimension} from '../types/attributes/Dimension.type';

export let dimension: Dimension = {width: "800", height: "300"} as Dimension;
```

### Adding hatches

To be able to distinguish the individual bars even better, you can give them hatch patterns.
To do this, you only have to set **hatchPatterns** to **true**.

<Canvas>
  <Story 
    name="Adding hatches"
    args={{
        chartInfo: {
        title: "Revenue of three big companies",
        desc: "The bar chart shows the revenue for Apple, Google and Microsoft divided in the seasons.",
        source: "https://www.w3.org"
      },
      labels: {x: "Seasons", y: "Euro in million", secondY: ''},
      series: testTwoBarSeries,
      hatchPatterns: true,
    }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
