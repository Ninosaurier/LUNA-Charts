# LineChart - Component

## What is a line chart needed for?

Line charts illustrate quantitative information as a series of data points connected by a line. 
These charts are often used to visualize data that changes over time

## Basic example

Below you can see an accessible diagram, with all its functions. Feel free to navigate with the 
tab key to navigate over the diagram. The screen reader will recognize 
the necessary text areas and read them for you.


export const Template = (args) => ({
  Component: LineChart,
  props: args,
});

<Canvas>
  <Story 
    name="Basic example"
    args={{
      chartInfo: {
        title: "A typical line chart",
        desc: "This is a accessible description. Your screenreader will read it for you.",
        source: "https://www.w3.org"
      },
      labels: {x: "Seasons", y: "Euro in million", secondY: ''},
      series: testLineSeries,
    }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Adding Information

In order to understand what the chart should represent, we will add some information to the chart. 
For this we use the data type **ChartInfo**. With **ChartInfo** you can give the chart a title, 
a description and a source. The special thing about the title is that the chart automatically generates the correct header tag.
Should there be a **h1**-tag on the web page, 
the title will automatically adapt and create a **h2**-tag.

```ts
import type {ChartInfo} from '../types/attributes/ChartInfo.types';

export let chartInfo: ChartInfo = {
  title: "A typical line chart",
  desc: "This is a accessible description. Your screenreader will read it for you.",
  source: "https://www.w3.org"
} as ChartInfo
```

### Modification of Labels

To give the reader more information and to explain the lines and points in more detail, you can use **Labels**.
Labels is a data type that allows you to add axis labels to the chart. 
**Labels** takes three parameters:
- x: Defines the label of the x-axis
- y: Defines the label of the Y-axis 
- secondY: Defines the label of the second Y-axis

```ts
import {type Labels} from '../types/attributes/Labels.type';

export let labels: Labels = {x: "X-Value", y: "Y-Value", secondY: ''} as Labels;
```
### Adding series

To visualize the lines, we still need to give the Series to the diagram. For each diagram there is a suitable
data type. For a line chart we use **LineSeries[]**. Furthermore we need 
the data type **Points**.

```ts
import type { Points } from '../types/series/Point.type';
import type { LineSeries } from '../types/series/LineSeries.type';

const aLotOfPoints: Points[] = [
  {
    x: 100,
    y: 10,
    ariaLabel: 'Point 1',
  },
  {
    x: 120,
    y: 50,
    ariaLabel: 'Point 2',
  },
];

export const testLineSeries: LineSeries[] = [
  {
    name: 'Line 1',
    points: aLotOfPoints,
    color: '',
  },
];

```
### Theming

You can add colors to the diagram. But you don't have to. The library provides automatically defined colors.
You can find them in "src/theme/defaultTheme.ts". Here is an example:

```ts

import { HATCH_PATTERNS } from '../types/theme/Hatch.type.ts';
import { CONTRAST_COLORS } from '../types/theme/Theme.type.ts';
import type { LineTheme } from '../types/theme/Theme.type';

export const defaultLineTheme: LineTheme = {
  name: 'defaultLineTheme',
  colors: CONTRAST_COLORS,
  circles: {
    radius: '3px',
    focusColor: '#000000',
    focusRadius: '50px',
  },
  wrapperStyles: {
    backgroundColor: '#F7F7F7',
  },
  grid: {
    gridColor: '',
    gridSize: '',
  },
};
```
At this point, there is one more small feature. The library creates a CSS variable from each attribute.
Except **colors**. For example, if you want to use the color of the wrapper in the style, 
you can write the following:

```css
.an_element{
  background-color: var(--wrapperStyles-backgroundColor);
}
```

### Dimension

With **Dimension** you can give the diagram a fixed width and size:
```ts
import type {Dimension} from '../types/attributes/Dimension.type';

export let dimension: Dimension = {width: "800", height: "300"} as Dimension;
```
